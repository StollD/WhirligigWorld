	description = The Kaputnik Mk0 Electro-Mechanical Program Executor And Four-function Integrated Advanced Calculator is an advanced computer utilizing digital cog-o-matic™ style computation circuits, capable of running a basic preset flight program. Features include pointing the spacecraft Prograde/Retrograde, Normal/Antinormal, and Radial In/Out, as well as staging the vehicle and adjusting its throttle. This incredibly advanced program exector, while totally genius, is also incredibly heavy. We expect to miniaturize this technology in the future, and potentially develop remote control input to change the program in-flight to allow real-time steering and pointing of the craft.
