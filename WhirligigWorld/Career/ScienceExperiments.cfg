		KerbinInSpaceLow = The telescope surveys the sky for Mesbin ring moonlets, and takes infrared observations of Mesbin's satellites.
		KerbinSrfLanded = The telescope, being a static mounted device, is unable to take useful photographs of celestial bodies due to the rotation rate of Mesbin. The pictures all come out blurry.
		
		ReanderInSpace = The telescope detects hotspots in the cloud bands and storms of Reander. The planet emits almost as much thermal energy as it recieves from Kaywell.
		ReanderInSpace = Taken thermal infrared luminosity readings of Yalthe and Yokane from Reander orbit.
		
		YaltheInSpaceHigh = The telescope detects many volcanic hotspots not seen in visible light.
		
		YokaneInSpaceHigh = The telescope detects many volcanic hotspots not seen in visible light.
		
		YawerSrfLanded = The telescope, being a static mounted device, is unable to take useful photographs of celestial bodies due to the rotation rate of Mesbin. The pictures all come out blurry.
		
		GememmaInSpaceLow = The telescope is too warm to function correctly.
		GememmaInSpaceHigh = The telescope peers out into space, scanning for minor planets and other celestial bodies within the Gememma system.
		
		AmmenonInSpace = The telescope is too warm to function correctly.
		AmmenonSrfLandedIceCaps = The telescope observes the skies, searching for minor planets within the Gememma system.
		
		LowelInSpaceHigh = Detected hot spots on Ollym.
		
		OllymInSpace = Detected thermal hot spots on Ollym's volcanoes.
		
		MandrakeInSpace = Mandrake is emitting more thermal radiation than it recieves from Kaywell and Gememma combined.
		RutherfordInSpace = Rutherford is not thermally luminous, and shines only due to reflected infrared from Gememma and Kaywell.
