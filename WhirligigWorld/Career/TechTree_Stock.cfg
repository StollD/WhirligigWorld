	%description = Cavern goo was discovered during a spelunking expedition into a newly discovered cave. The cave was closed off from the surface and held a thick hydrogen-helium atmosphere. The cave had deep vertical shafts which lead down to mesbothermal vents, and had pools of liquid water all around. On closer inspection, the liquid water turned out to be a living organism. The explorers rejoiced that they had discovered a new life form native to Mesbin! It quickly became a delicacy, and while some scientists argue that eating mystery goo is highly moraly questionable due to the probability of the mysterious cave goo being sentient, others argue that it makes a delicious sauce. Anyway, mystery goo seems to react wildly to different stimuli, so perhaps it can tell us something about various alien environments.
