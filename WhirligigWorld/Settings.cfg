{
	Homeworld = Mesbin
	
	//pick either Mesbin or Kerbmun.
	//default is Mesbin.
	//If you play on Kerbmun you will have to go into WhirligigWorld/Career and for the files:
	//TechTree_CTT.cfg, TechTree_MakingHistory.cfg, and TechTree_Stock.cfg,
	//back them up and delete them, or change .cfg to .txt.
	//A proper patch to handle tech tree switching is a planned feature.
	//Science definitions and planet descriptions are also still the default Mesbincentric ones, but science multipliers are modified to be correct.
