		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Sun = We have rediscovered our sun, Kaywell's Star! The astrophysical records are correct, Kaywell shows spectral characteristics of an F7V type hot white main sequence star. And it's old for a white star, too.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Kaywell = We have rediscovered Kaywell's Star! The astrophysical records are correct, Kaywell shows spectral characteristics of an F7V type hot white main sequence star. And it's old for a white star, too.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Jifgif = We have discovered a tiny moon orbiting very close to Tyepolbynar!
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Imterril = Here is a large pale blue moon orbiting Tyepolbynar. It glows rather luminously in the infrared... it must be very hot there.

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Vizea = We have discovered a very small planet--a dwarf planet--orbiting Kaywell in the same orbit as Mesbin! It's a trojan dwarf planet!
		
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Kerbin = This is our home, even if it isn't Kerbalkind's. A crashed colony.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Mesbin = We have discovered a large supergiant terrestrial planet. No atmosphere. It is rapidly spinning and oblate in shape. Frisbee planet?
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Statmun = We have discovered that Mount Sky is actually a small moon in a mesostationary orbit, rather than a magical palace placed hovering in the sky by nefarious gods.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Graymun = A gray moon, covered in craters. It shall be called Graymun.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Kerbmun = We have found a blue and brown moon of Mesbin. We have seen it eclipse the Sun, and we are sure it has oxygen in its atmosphere!

		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Gememma = The bright red star "Rodocer", thought to be a giant star, has recently been discovered by astronomer Gememma Kerman to actually be a much, much closer red dwarf star of the spectral type M8V, so close that it is in fact orbiting Kaywell. It has been rechristened as "Gememma's Star."
		
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ammenon = By measuring periodic decreases in Gememma's brightness over time, and by measuring its slight wobble by doppler spectroscopy, we have determined that there exists a dwarf planet in a very tight orbit around Gememma.
		
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Lowel = Gememma has a planet! By measuring the star's wobble over time, we have discovered the presence of a small planet in Gememma's habitable zone. We were then able to search for the planet itself, which we found and named Lowel.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Ollym = Close observations of Gememma's planet Lowel have revealed that it wobbles back and forth every few hours, indicating it has a massive companion. High resolution photographs of Lowel were taken when it was angularly furthest from Gememma, confirming the presence of a massive second planet.
		
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Gannovar = We have discovered a planet in an eccentric orbit around Gememma. It spends most of its time far away from the star, but ever once in a while it flings by Gememma, causing it to wobble enough for us to detect it by radial velocity.
		
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Mandrake = Conjoined twin astronomers Mandrake and Rutherford have discovered a giant blue planet orbiting far away from Kaywell.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Rutherford = Conjoined twin astronomers Mandrake and Rutherford have done it again! The blue planet Mandrake is actually a binary of two distinct planets. The other planet has been fittingly named Rutherford.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Lozon = A small moon of Mandrake and Rutherford's planet has been found, orbiting surprisingly close to Rutherford.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Beagrid = A small moon of Mandrake and Rutherford's planet has been found.
		#autoLOC_RBodies_discovery_Jancy = A small brown moon of Mandrake and Rutherford's planet has been found.
